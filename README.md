## CoffeeHood - A coffee shop finder

This web application is a final project I completed as part of my curriculum at Flatiron School's software engineering program. It was built using a React front-end and a Ruby on Rails back-end. Styling was done using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

## Message to the User

It's a Monday night, 7 pm, you have an important project due tomorrow for school/work, and you need some caffeine to keep your brain running at full speed.  You don't want to make coffee at home because the Keurig machine is broken, and frankly, your sick of mediocre k cups.  Where can you go nearby that has awesome coffee, is open late, is quiet like home, and facilitates focus?  This is where this application comes in.

I found that the cafe industry was lacking a decent search and locate app. Yes, I know there is Yelp - but I felt cafes needed their own app - where you could search and filter by uniqe tags such as "good for studying" or "cozy", and find their locations using an easy to use interactive map. This application is the start of my effort to build something that helps people do this.  It is a work in progress, and far from finished - I will be continuing to add features such as filtered searches and improving show pages.  Feel free to add features and contribute to this project!
